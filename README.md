# What is this WordPress plugin all about?

It is for service based industries who wants to create a database of clients, and create quotes & invoices for them and download in PDF. Except this plugin comes with a bit of a twist...
You can create "Local Predefined Tasks" or "Global Predefined Tasks". The difference?
Local Predefined Tasks = Tasks that are unique to the quote and that will only be used once.
Global Predefined Tasks = Tasks that will be used over and over, like maybe an onsite support fee.
But don't worry! There are full tutorials in the plugin that shows you how to use it!
This plugin is a real time-saver in terms of quote creation and we highly recommend you at least check it out.

## Any questions?
Contact details are inside the plugin, and we are available should you need any customization/further development done.
